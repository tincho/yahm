# Yet Another HangMan game

For educational purposes as you can guess ;)

`hangMan.js` is the core module

`hangMan.html` and
`hangMan.gui.js` 
are a super-simple web interface

`hangMan.cli.js` is a (To Be Done!) command-line interface

Unit Tests are in `test/`

The aim is to write an "isomorphic" JS module covered by unit tests,
depicting some concepts as "private" functions and prototypal inheritance.
